/**
 * Policy mappings (ACL)
 *
 * Policies are simply Express middleware functions which run **before** your controllers.
 * You can apply one or more policies to a given controller, or protect just one of its actions.
 *
 * Any policy file (e.g. `authenticated.js`) can be dropped into the `/policies` folder,
 * at which point it can be accessed below by its filename, minus the extension, (e.g. `authenticated`)
 *
 * For more information on policies, check out:
 * http://sailsjs.org/#documentation

/**
 * Here's what the `isNiceToAnimals` policy from above might look like:
 * (this file would be located at `policies/isNiceToAnimals.js`)
 *
 * We'll make some educated guesses about whether our system will
 * consider this user someone who is nice to animals.
 *
 * Besides protecting rabbits (while a noble cause, no doubt), 
 * here are a few other example use cases for policies:
 *
 *	+ cookie-based authentication
 *	+ role-based access control
 *	+ limiting file uploads based on MB quotas
 *	+ OAuth
 *	+ BasicAuth
 *	+ or any other kind of authentication scheme you can imagine

# AwsSailsExample
### a Sails application

This is my playground for testing new ideas:

* Throwing Sails.js on Elastic Beanstalk so that it scales automatically.
* 100% functional web-sockets to Elastic Beanstalk (weirder than you think).
* Uploading, downloading, deleting images with an s3 bucket.
* REST interface to AWS DynamoDB, supporting both hash-only and hash-range indices.
